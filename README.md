DISCO
=====

Just a silly animation generated by Claude to test static HTML deploy on Coolify.

Here's Claude's thinking behind the design:

**Perspective & Layout**

I used CSS 3D transforms (`rotateX(65deg)`) to create that receding dance floor effect from your original image—where the tiles appear to stretch toward a vanishing point on the horizon. This immediately gives it that classic disco floor look you'd see in a club or music video.

**Color Palette**

I pulled the neon colors directly from your image: hot pinks, electric blues, cyan, magenta, lime green, orange, and yellow. These are the quintessential 90s rave/disco colors—saturated, glowing, and high-contrast against the black background.

**Animation Patterns**

Rather than just random blinking (which would feel chaotic), I layered several distinct patterns that alternate:

- *Random scatter* — the base layer, always running, gives that frenetic energy
- *Wave sweeps* — vertical lines that roll across the floor
- *Radial bursts* — circles that expand outward from random points
- *Checkerboard flashes* — alternating tiles in two colors
- *Line sweeps* — horizontal or vertical lines that travel across

This variety mimics how real disco lighting systems were programmed with different "chase" patterns.

**The Disco Ball**

No 90s disco is complete without one! I created it using layered radial and conic gradients to simulate the mirrored facets, with a slow rotation animation. The light beams emanating from it use gradient lines that pulse in opacity.

**Atmospheric Effects**

The purple-tinted fog at the bottom and occasional strobe flash add that smoky club atmosphere. These subtle touches sell the environment without overwhelming the main tile animation.

**Glow Effects**

Each lit tile gets a `box-shadow` with multiple layers of the same color, creating that soft neon glow that bleeds onto the surrounding dark surface—essential for that authentic luminous look.
